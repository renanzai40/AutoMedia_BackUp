"""Mock helpers for testing LLM-driven gates without real API calls.

Provides context managers that patch
:func:`automedia.core.llm_client._structured_completion_with_fallback`
— the internal function that actually makes LLM API calls.

Why ``_structured_completion_with_fallback`` and not
``llm_complete_structured_safe``?
Because ``_structured_completion_with_fallback`` is looked up via
**module-level name resolution** (not ``from ... import``), so a single
patch at the definition site correctly intercepts all call paths —
including calls made via  ``llm_check_with_fallback`` (which submits
``llm_complete_structured_safe`` to a thread pool executor).

Usage
-----
>>> from tests.mock_llm import mock_llm_response
>>> from automedia.gates.llm_helpers import llm_check_with_fallback, G0CheckResult
>>>
>>> data = G0CheckResult(passed=True, issues=[])
>>> with mock_llm_response(data) as mock:
...     outcome = llm_check_with_fallback(
...         text="...",
...         check_type="fact_check",
...         prompt_template_name="g0_fact_check",
...         deterministic_fn=lambda t: {"passed": True, "issues": []},
...     )
...     assert outcome["method"] == "llm"
...     assert outcome["passed"] is True

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Patch target
#
# We patch the INTERNAL function _structured_completion_with_fallback, not
# the public llm_complete_structured_safe.  Reason: llm_complete_structured
# _safe delegates by name to _structured_completion_with_fallback _within_
# the same module.  Even when some callers have grabbed llm_complete_structured
# _safe via ``from ... import``, the inner name lookup resolves against the
# module dict, which *is* affected by the patch.
